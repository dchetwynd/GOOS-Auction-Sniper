This repo contains the Java code examples from the "Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided By Tests" book by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce:

This is a fantastic intermediate-advanced TDD book. Part 2 of the book guides the reader through creating an "Auction Sniper" application for bidding in online auctions, where this repo gives the code for that second part. The examples are written in Java and use standard Java testing tools such as JUnit, JMock, Hamcrest and Window Licker. Functionality is gradually added to the Auction Sniper application with outside-in acceptance tests, which are then used to drive the creation of smaller unit tests.

If you're a developer who is familiar with Test-Driven Development and wish to improve your TDD skills, I'd strongly recommend this book. The book assumes that you already have some Java knowledge.
